# simpleP2P - Simple Peer-to-Peer Transfers with Multi-GPU

## Description

This application demonstrates CUDA APIs that support Peer-To-Peer (P2P) copies, Peer-To-Peer (P2P) addressing, and Unified Virtual Memory Addressing (UVA) between multiple GPUs. In general, P2P is supported between two same GPUs with some exceptions, such as some Tesla and Quadro GPUs.

## Key Concepts

Performance Strategies, Asynchronous Data Transfers, Unified Virtual Address Space, Peer to Peer Data Transfers, Multi-GPU
