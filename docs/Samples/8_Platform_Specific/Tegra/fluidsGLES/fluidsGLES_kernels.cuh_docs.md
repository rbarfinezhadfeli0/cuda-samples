// arrays holding the Fourier coefficients of the velocity field in
// X and Y. Diffusion in this space takes a simple form described as:
// v(k,t) = v(k,t) / (1 + visc * dt * k^2), where visc is the viscosity,
// and k is the wavenumber. The projection step forces the Fourier
// velocity vectors to be orthogonal to the wave wave vectors for each
// wavenumber: v(k,t) = v(k,t) - ((k dot v(k,t) * k) / k^2.
__global__ void diffuseProject_k(cData *vx, cData *vy, int dx, int dy, float dt, float visc, int lb);

// This method updates the velocity field 'v' using the two complex

// real components by 1/(dx*dy) to account for an unnormalized FFT.

// according to the velocity field and time step. That is, for each
// particle: p(t+1) = p(t) + dt * v(p(t)).
